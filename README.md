# Jufo2021

In this repository all code and data, that were used in the making of my written elaboration of my project for the competition Jugend forscht 2021 can be found. Furthermore some additional data is also included

**NOT** included is the "PredictionToolbox", that I obtained thankfully from Mr. Katzir, and which was used to carry out the analysis described by *Zimmer et al.* ([link](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/10442)). In case of questions regarding that code, the contact informations to the authors of the paper can be found in the linked paper.

## Structure

* the code used for creating figures and doing the statistical analysis
